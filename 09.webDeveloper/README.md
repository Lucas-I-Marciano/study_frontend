In week 9, I began my journey into **React.js**. My focus was to understand the fundamentals of components, props, and styling with CSS. I started simple, building individual components like a button, and gradually composed a full Kanban-style app using reusable components and dynamic rendering.

### ðŸ§© Key Learnings

- **Component creation with props**: I created a reusable `Button` component that changes style based on the `variant` prop.
- **Props and dynamic styling**: Passed custom props like `colorScheme`, `variant`, and `disabled` to change the buttonâ€™s appearance and behavior dynamically.
- **Component architecture**: Built an app using `Header`, `Main`, `Footer`, and `Article` components, each with its own folder and CSS.
- **Array methods in practice**: Used `.map()` to dynamically generate multiple `Article` components.
- **Typography and alignment**: Developed a `Text` component to control text size and alignment using props.
- **Project structure**:
  ```
  src/
  â”œâ”€â”€ components/
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Button/
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Header/
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Footer/
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Main/
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Article/
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Text/
  â””â”€â”€ App.jsx
  ```
