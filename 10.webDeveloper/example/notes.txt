Hook
    Component will not refresh using javascript variables in a child element, I can re-render using Hook

State 
    Hook of state I import 'import { useState } from "react"'
    To declare -> const [state, setState] = useState(<initial_value>)

Effect
    Used to get use of extenal data (api, document.title)
    Function called directly, expecting two params -> Function and Array
    Function -> Declare what will change / do
    Array -> What useEffect will listen of changing to call the function
